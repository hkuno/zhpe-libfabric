.SH NAME
.PP
fi_mrail \- The Multi\-Rail Utility Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The mrail provider (ofi_mrail) is an utility provider that layers over
an underlying provider to enable the use of multiple network ports
(rails).
This increases the total available bandwidth of an underlying proivder.
The current status of mrail provider is experimental \- not all
libfabric features are supported and performance is not guaranteed.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.SS Requirements for underlying provider
.PP
mrail provider requires the underlying provider to support the following
capabilities / modes:
.IP \[bu] 2
Buffered receive (FI_BUFFERED_RECV)
.IP \[bu] 2
FI_SOURCE
.IP \[bu] 2
FI_AV_TABLE
.SS Requirements for applications
.PP
Applications need to: * Support FI_MR_RAW MR mode bit to make use of
FI_RMA capability.
* Set FI_OFI_MRAIL_ADDR_STRC env variable (see RUNTIME PARAMETERS
section below).
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.TP
.B \f[I]Endpoint types\f[]
The provider supports only \f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[].

.SS Unsupported features
.PP
The following are the major libfabric features that are not supported.
Any other feature not listed in "Supported features" can be assumed as
unsupported.
.IP \[bu] 2
FI_ATOMIC
.IP \[bu] 2
Scalable endpoints
.IP \[bu] 2
Shared contexts
.IP \[bu] 2
FABRIC_DIRECT
.IP \[bu] 2
Multicast
.IP \[bu] 2
Triggered operations
.SH FUNCTIONALITY OVERVIEW
.PP
For messages (FI_MSG, FI_TAGGED), the provider sends one message per
rail in a round\-robin manner.
Ordering is guaranteed through the use of sequence numbers.
For RMA, the data is striped equally across all rails.
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.PP
The ofi_mrail provider checks for the following environment variables.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OFI_MRAIL_ADDR_STRC\f[]
Comma delimited list of individual rail addresses in FI_ADDR_STR format.
